# Taxonomies For Pages

The 'Taxonomies for Pages' plugin adds the category and tag metaboxes, seen in the post editor, to the page editor.
These metaboxes work exactly the same way as the ones for posts with no extra fluff added to it. Once the taxonomies
are added, the pages will be included in the archive pages.

Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository or download from the WordPress.
1. Upload `taxonomies-for-pages` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
